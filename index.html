      <p id="funnyStoryBody"> 
        It was my 10th birthday and I was a bit sad because my parents where strugling and could not give me or my twin brother birthday gifts.
        So me and my brother and sisters are out playing in a park near our house, together with some neigborhood friends and cousins and I find a wallet on the ground.
        It had some money in it. I think about 50 euros. We all argue but in the end we decide to give it to local police station.
        After that we go home, thinking why we didnt keep the money, it was mine and my twin birthday, we could have gotten something for us. 
        But alas our mother's values spoke louder. We get home and surprise, surprise our favorite uncle has come to visit and gives each one of us 20 euros has birthday present.
        We jump of happiness and I my first reqction was to go straight to the supermarket!
        To go buy fruity yogurts and cookies, wich was something we never had in the house. So my favorite thing those days was to eat sweets more than anything.
